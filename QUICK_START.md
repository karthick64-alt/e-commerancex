# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Add Images

4. See `IMAGE_SETUP.md` for detailed requirements

### Step 2: Open the Website
1. Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Or use a local server for better experience:
   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Then visit: http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Step 3: Customize
1. Edit `assets/css/style.css` to change colors
2. Edit `assets/js/app.js` to modify products
3. Customize HTML files as needed
