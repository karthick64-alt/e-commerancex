## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress images** before uploading to improve page load speed
2. **Use appropriate formats**: JPG for photos, PNG for logos with transparency
3. **Maintain aspect ratios** for consistent display
4. **Name files descriptively** for easy management

## Testing

After adding images:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Check that all images load correctly
3. Verify responsive behavior on mobile devices
4. Ensure text alignment is not affected by images

## Notes

- All images use CSS for proper alignment
- Text alignment is independent of images
- Images are responsive and scale properly
- Missing images will show broken image icons - replace them!
